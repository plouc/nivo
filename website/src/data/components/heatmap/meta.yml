    This component is available in the `@nivo/api`, see
    [sample](api:/samples/heatmap.svg) or
    [try it using the API client](self:/heatmap/api).
    You can also see more example usages in

    A variation around the [HeatMap](self:/heatmap/) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveHeatMapCanvas`.
