    An heat map matrix, you can chose between various colors scales
    or pass yours, you also have the ability to change the cell shape
    for rectangle or circle and even use a custom rendering function.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveHeatMap`.

    This component is available in the `@nivo/api`, see
    [sample](api:/samples/heatmap.svg) or
    [try it using the API client](self:/heatmap/api).
    You can also see more example usages in
    [the storybook](storybook:heatmap--default).

HeatMapCanvas:
  package: '@nivo/heatmap'
  tags:
    - canvas
  stories: []
  description: |
    A variation around the [HeatMap](self:/heatmap) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveHeatMapCanvas`.
