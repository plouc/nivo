    Bar chart which can display multiple data series, stacked or side by side. Also
    supports both vertical and horizontal layout, with negative values descending
    below the x axis (or y axis if using horizontal layout).

    The bar item component can be customized to render any valid SVG element, it
    will receive current bar style, data and event handlers,
    the storybook offers an [example](storybook:bar--custom-bar-item).

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveBar`.

    This component is available in the `@nivo/api`,
    see [sample](api:/samples/bar.svg)
    or [try it using the API client](self:/bar/api).

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.
    However it requires an extra property for each legend configuration you pass to
    `legends` property: `dataFrom`, it defines how to compute
    legend's data and accept `indexes` or `keys`.
    `indexes` is suitable for simple bar chart with a single data serie
    while `keys` may be used if you have several ones (groups).

BarCanvas:
  package: '@nivo/bar'
  tags:
    - canvas
  description: |
    A variation around the [Bar](self:/bar) component. Well suited for
    large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth, however you'll
    lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveBarCanvas`.
