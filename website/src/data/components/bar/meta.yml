    Bar chart which can display multiple data series, stacked or side by side. Also
    supports both vertical and horizontal layout, with negative values descending
    below the x axis (or y axis if using horizontal layout).
    The bar item component can be customized to render any valid SVG element, it
    will receive current bar style, data and event handlers,
    there's an example in [storybook](storybook:bar--custom-bar-item).

    A variation around the [Bar](self:/bar) component. Well suited for
    large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth, however you'll
    lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.
