    A waffle component. You can fully customize it using `cellComponent`
    property to define your own cell component, if you wish to do so
    you should have a look at
    [native SVG component](https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/packages/nivo-waffle/src/WaffleCell.js)
    for available properties.

    You can also see more example usages in
    [the storybook](storybook:waffle--default).

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveWaffle`,
    it also offers other implementations, see
    [WaffleHtml](self:/waffle/html) and
    [WaffleCanvas](self:/waffle/canvas).

    A variation around the [Waffle](self:/waffle) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.
