    A waffle component. You can fully customize it using the `cellComponent`
    property to define your own cell component, if you wish to do so
    you should have a look at
    [native SVG component](https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/packages/nivo-waffle/src/WaffleCell.tsx)
    for available properties.

    You can also see more example usages in
    [storybook](storybook:waffle--docs).

    A variation around the [Waffle](self:/waffle) component,
    using HTML elements.

    You can fully customize it using `cellComponent` property to define
    your own cell component, if you wish to do so you should have a look at
    [native HTML component](href="https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/packages/nivo-waffle/src/WaffleCellHtml.tsx)
    for available properties.

    You can also see more example usages in
    [storybook](storybook:wafflehtml--docs).

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveWaffleHtml`, it also offers other implementations,
    see [Waffle](self:/waffle) and
    [WaffleCanvas](self:/waffle/canvas).

    A variation around the [Waffle](self:/waffle) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.
