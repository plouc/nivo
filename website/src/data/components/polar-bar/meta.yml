    The Polar Bar chart component displays data in a circular layout
    where each bar extends radially from the center.
    
    Unlike radial bar charts, which vary both angle and length, polar bar charts use
    equal angular spacing for each category (defined by `indexBy`) and rely on bar length
    to represent values, making them perfect for visualizing cyclical patterns like seasons,
    compass directions, or time-based data.
