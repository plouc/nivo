  description: |
    This chart shows each value using a small waffle chart,
    meaning each value has its own waffle chart.
    This is a fancy alternative to an heatmap, rather than color
    coding, the number of *value cells* represents the value.

    You should be careful with the number of cells you end up with,
    the chart will become janky if you have too many cells,
    especially transitions.

    Each cell can represent more than `1`, this is managed via
    the `cellValue` property, it can be used to reduce the number
    of cells displayed, let's say your chart shows
    the repartition of gender for a given salary, you might have
    to deal with high values, then you can say that 1 cell = 100 people
    for example.

    Please note that each waffle chart is a square.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveWaffleGrid`.
