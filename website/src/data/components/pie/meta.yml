    Generates a pie chart from an array of data, each datum must have an
    id and a value property.
    Note that margin object does not take radial labels into account,
    so you should adjust it to leave enough room for it.

    A variation around the [Pie](self:/pie) component. Well suited for
    large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth, however you'll
    lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsivePieCanvas`.

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.
