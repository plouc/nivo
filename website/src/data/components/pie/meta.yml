    Generates a pie chart from an array of data, each datum must have an
    id and a value property.
    Note that margin object does not take radial labels into account,
    so you should adjust it to leave enough room for it.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsivePie`.

    This component is available in the `@nivo/api`, see
    [sample](api:/samples/pie.svg)  or
    [try it using the API client](self:/pie/api).
    You can also see more example usages in
    [the storybook](storybook:pie--default).

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.

PieCanvas:
  package: '@nivo/pie'
  tags:
    - radial
    - canvas
  stories: []
  description: |
    A variation around the [Pie](self:/pie) component. Well suited for
    large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth, however you'll
    lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsivePieCanvas`.

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.
