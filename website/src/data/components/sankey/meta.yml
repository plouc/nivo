  description: |
    Computes a sankey diagram from nodes and links, built
    on top of [d3-sankey](https://github.com/d3/d3-sankey).
    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveSankey`.

    Please be careful with the data you use for this chart as
    it does not support cyclic dependencies.
    For example, something like `A —> A`
    or `A —> B —> C —> A` will crash.

    This component is available in the `@nivo/api`,
    see [sample](api:/samples/sankey.svg) or
    [try it using the API client](self:/sankey/api).
    You can also see more example usages in
    [the storybook](storybook:sankey--default).

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.
