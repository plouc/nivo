    A tree map component using
    [d3-hierarchy.treemap](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy#treemap),
    see [this demo](https://observablehq.com/@d3/treemap).

    You can fully customize it using `nodeComponent` property to define
    your own node component, if you wish to do so you should have a look at
    [native SVG node component](https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/src/components/charts/treemap/TreeMapNode.js)
    for available properties.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveTreeMap`,
    it also offers other implementations, see
    [TreeMapHtml](self:/treemap/html) and
    [TreeMapCanvas](self:/treemap/canvas).

    The `TreeMap` component is also available in the `@nivo/api`,
    see [sample](api:/samples/treemap)
    or [try it using the API client](self:/treemap/api).

    A variation around the [TreeMap](self:/treemap) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveTreeMapCanvas`, it also offers other implementations,
    see [TreeMap](self:/treemap) and
    [TreeMapHtml](self:/treemap/html).
