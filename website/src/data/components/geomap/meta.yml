    This component can be used to draw maps, it takes an array of
    features which determine the geometries to render on the map.
    It can be used to build more complex maps such as
    the [Choropleth](self:/choropleth).

    Using this component requires some knowledge about the `d3-geo`
    library, projections, geoJSON… please have a look at the
    [official d3 documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo)
    for further information.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveGeoMap`,
    it also offers a canvas implementations, see
    [GeoMapCanvas](self:/geomap/canvas).

    A canvas implementation of the [GeoMap](self:/geomap)
    component, should be used used when you have complex
    geometries as it offers better performance than its SVG
    counterpart.
