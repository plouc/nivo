    The `Marimekko` component is somewhat similar to a bar chart,
    but it allows you to use an extra dimension to compute the
    thickness of each bar.

    It also shares some behavior of the `Stream` chart regarding
    the way we can configure the `offset`.

    You can also see more example usages in
    [the storybook](storybook:marimekko--default).

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.
