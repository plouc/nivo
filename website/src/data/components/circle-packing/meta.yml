    Hierarchical CirclePacking chart with zooming ability.

    You can fully customize it using the `circleComponent` property
    to define your own, if you wish to do so you should have a look at
    [the default SVG component](https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/packages/circle-packing/src/CircleSvg.tsx)
    to get started.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveCirclePacking`.
    It also offers other implementations, see [CirclePackingHtml](self:/circle-packing/html)
    and [CirclePackingCanvas](self:/circle-packing/canvas).

    You can also see more example usages in [storybook](storybook:circlepacking--default).

  # Disabled until the API is fixed
  #   This component is available in the `@bitbloom/nivo-api`,
  #   see [sample](api:/samples/circle-packing.svg)
  #   or [try it using the API client](self:/circle-packing/api).

    A variation around the [CirclePacking](self:/circle-packing) component.

    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveCirclePackingCanvas`.
    It also offers other implementations, see [CirclePacking](self:/circle-packing)
    and [CirclePackingHtml](self:/circle-packing/html).
