    Hierarchical CirclePacking chart with zooming ability.

    You can fully customize it using the `circleComponent` property
    to define your own, if you wish to do so you should have a look at
    [the default SVG component](https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/packages/circle-packing/src/CircleSvg.tsx)
    to get started.

    You can also see more example usages in [storybook](storybook:circlepacking--default).

    A variation around the [CirclePacking](self:/circle-packing) component.

    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.
