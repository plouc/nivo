    The Bump chart can be used to show the ranking of several series
    over time. It is quite similar to [line](self:/line/) charts,
    but instead of graphing some measure on the y-axis,
    it only shows the ranking of each serie at a given time.

    If you'd like to show the ranking and also graph the
    y-axis values, you can also you use the [AreaBump](self:/area-bump/)
    component.
