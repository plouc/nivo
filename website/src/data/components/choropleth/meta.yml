    The Choropleth component displays divided geographical areas shaded
    in relation to some data variable. It's build on top of primitives
    from the [GeoMap](self:/geomap) component.

    Using this component requires some knowledge about the `d3-geo`
    library, projections, geoJSONâ€¦ please have a look at the
    [official d3 documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo)
    for further information.

    Like for [GeoMap](self:/geomap), you must pass an array of features
    which determine the geometries to render on the map, then you pass
    an array of data which, each datum is merged with its corresponding
    feature using the `match` property, the value is picked according
    to the `value` accessor.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveChoropleth`.
    This component also have a canvas implementations,
    [ChoroplethCanvas](self:/choropleth/canvas), which should be used
    when you have complex geometries as it offers better performance.

    A canvas implementation of the [Choropleth](self:/choropleth)
    component, should be used used when you have complex geometries
    as it offers better performance than its SVG counterpart.

    `ResponsiveChoropleth`.
