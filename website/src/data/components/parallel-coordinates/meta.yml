    Parallel coordinates chart, supports continuous numerical

  description: |
    A variation around the
    [ParallelCoordinates](self:/parallel-coordinates) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.
    
    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveParallelCoordinatesCanvas`.
