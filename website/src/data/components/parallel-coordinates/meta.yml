    Parallel coordinates chart, supports continuous numerical
    variables and discrete values.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveParallelCoordinates`, it also offers another
    implementation, see
    [ParallelCoordinatesCanvas](self:/parallel-coordinates/canvas).

    The `@nivo/parallel-coordinates` package also exposes a
    `ParallelCoordinatesLayout` component which can be used to build
    your very own chart. You can see how it's used to build the
    `ParallelCoordinates` component
    [here](https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/packages/parallel-coordinates/src/ParallelCoordinates.js).

  description: |
    A variation around the
    [ParallelCoordinates](self:/parallel-coordinates) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.
    
    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveParallelCoordinatesCanvas`.
