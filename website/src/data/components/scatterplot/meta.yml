    A scatter plot chart, which can display several data series.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveScatterPlot`, it also offers another
    implementation, see [ScatterPlotCanvas](self:/scatterplot/canvas).
    You can also see more example usages in
    [the storybook](storybook:scatterplot--default).

    Alternatively, you can set `useMesh` to `true`
    to have finer interactions.

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.

    A variation around the [ScatterPlot](self:/scatterplot) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.
