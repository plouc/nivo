    The AreaBump chart is similar to the [Bump](self:/bump/) chart,
    but instead of only showing the ranking over time, it also shows
    the values on the y-axis.

    If you're only interested in ranking, you can also you use
    the [Bump](self:/bump/) component.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveAreaBump`.
