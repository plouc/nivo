    Line chart with stacking ability.

    Given an array of data series having an id and a nested array of points
    (with x, y properties), it will compute the line for each data serie.
    All datum having null x or y will be treated as holes, thus portions
    of the corresponding line will be skipped.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveLine`.

    This component is available in the `@nivo/api`, see
    [sample](api:/samples/line.svg) or
    [try it using the API client](self:/line/api).

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.

    A variation around the [Line](self:/line) component. Well suited
    for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth, however
    you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions (for now).

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveLineCanvas`.
