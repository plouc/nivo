    Line chart with stacking ability.

    Given an array of data series having an id and a nested array of points
    (with x, y properties), it will compute the line for each data series.
    All datum having null x or y will be treated as holes, thus portions
    of the corresponding line will be skipped.

    A variation around the [Line](self:/line) component. Well suited
    for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth, however
    you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.
