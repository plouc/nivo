    A network component connecting nodes with links using various forces,
    the resulting layout will depends on `linkDistance`, `centeringStrength`
    and `repulsivity`, so you should play with those parameters in order
    to achieve the desired result.

    You can also add some extra constrains via `distanceMin` and `distanceMax`.

    Please note that you can also use the `useNetwork` React hook if you want
    to handle the rendering by yourself, it accepts an object with almost
    the same props as the component and returns computed nodes & links.

    A variation around the [Network](self:/network/) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    to handle the rendering by yourself, it accepts an object with almost
