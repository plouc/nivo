  description: |
    A variation around the [Network](self:/network/) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveNetworkCanvas`.
