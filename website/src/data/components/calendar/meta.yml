    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveCalendar`,
    it also offers a canvas implementations, see
    [CalendarCanvas](self:/calendar/canvas).

    A variation around the [Calendar](self:/calendar) component.
    Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
    however you'll lose the isomorphic rendering ability.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveCalendarCanvas`.
