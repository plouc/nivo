    A funnel chart.

    This component also provides a React hook which can be used in *headless mode*:
    `useFunnel()`, meaning that you can compute the chart but handle the rendering
    by yourself, this hook supports almost the same properties as the chart.

    The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveFunnel`.
