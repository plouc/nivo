    The `Icicle` Chart is a space-filling visualization used to represent hierarchical data.
    It displays nested structures as stacked rectangles, where each rectangleâ€™s size typically
    reflects a quantitative value (like count, size, or duration).
    The chart provides a clear, compact view of tree-like data and allows users
    to quickly understand parent-child relationships and the relative weight of each node.
