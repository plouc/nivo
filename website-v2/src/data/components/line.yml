  Line chart with stacking ability.

  Given an array of data series having an id and a nested array of points (with x,
  y properties), it will compute the line for each data serie. All datum having
  null x or y will be treated as holes, thus portions of the corresponding line
  will be skipped.

  The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveLine`.

  This component is available in the [nivo-api](https://github.com/plouc/nivo-api),

  legends for this component.
