description: |
  Bar chart which can display multiple data series, stacked or side by side. Also
  supports both vertical and horizontal layout, with negative values descending
  below the x axis (or y axis if using horizontal layout).

  The bar item component can be customized to render any valid SVG element,
  it will receive current bar style, data and event handlers,
  the storybook offers an [example](/?selectedKind=Bar&selectedStory=custom%20bar%20item).

  The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveBar`.

  This component is available in the [nivo-api](https://github.com/plouc/nivo-api),
  see [sample](/samples/bar.svg) or
  [try it using the API client](/bar/api).

  See the [dedicated guide](/guides/legends) on how to setup legends for this component.
  However it requires an extra property for each legend configuration you pass to
  `legends` property: `dataFrom`, it defines how to compute legend's data and accept
  `indexes` or `keys`.
  `indexes` is suitable for simple bar chart with a single data serie
  while `keys` may be used if you have several ones (groups).
